# Predictive-Modeling-of-Human-Diseases-Using-Symptom-Encoding-and-SVM

This project focuses on building a predictive model for human diseases by encoding symptoms as numerical features and using Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification. The goal is to develop a system that can assist in early disease diagnosis by analyzing patient-reported symptoms and mapping them to potential medical conditions.
